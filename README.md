# hw04-quiz

## Description
I wanted to create a Javascript multiple choice quiz with a time limit that ended the quiz if the time went down to 0. I also wanted every wrong answer to subtract 10 seconds from the time. The score is supposed to be equal to the time remaining, and you should be able to submit your score.
